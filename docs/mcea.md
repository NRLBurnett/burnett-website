    </a>In 1996 Maine voters passed the <b><i>Maine Clean Election Act</i></b> and established the Maine Clean Election Fund through the citizens initiative process. This is a very special piece of legislation. It allows candidates for office to take a pledge to run clean by financing their campaign from MCEF funds only. The fund is financed from qualifying contributions from residents all across the state. A qualifying contribution is a $5 donation to the MCEA fund.<br><br>To make a qualifying contribution to my campaign you must be a resident of Senate District 22, Hiram, Porter, Baldwin, Standish, Sebago, Naples, Acton, Cornish, Limington, Limerick, Shapleigh, Parsonsfield, Newfield. The contribute button to the left begins the online contribution process, but the portal won't officially open until 2026, or you can contact me at <a class="email_link"><img src="/assets/images/email.jpg"></a> to arrange a way to donate in person by cash or cheque.<br><br>If a candidate hasn't taken the MCEA pledge they are getting their funding in much larger amounts from many fewer sources. My campaign will be financed entirely by you, the people I'm working towords representing in Augusta.
